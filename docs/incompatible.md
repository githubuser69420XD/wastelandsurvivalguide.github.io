# Incompatible Mods

---

###### Adapted from [TTW forum](https://taleoftwowastelands.com/viewtopic.php?f=50&t=6878)

This is by no means an exhaustive list, and the following points cannot be stressed enough:
:::caution Check for conflicts with xEdit
Learn to use it, no exceptions!
:::
:::danger Unconverted Fallout 3 Mods are Not Compatible
Any FO3 mods with .ESM/ESP and/or animations and meshes are not compatible!
:::
:::danger LOOT is useless with TTW!
LOOT relies on a masterlist being maintained by humans, and nobody maintains
that list for Fallout New Vegas, let alone for TTW. Consequently there is no underlying logic
when you use LOOT on TTW - your mods will essentially be randomized. **Don't use it!**

## Known to be Incompatible

#### A Familiar Friend and Readius/Any handheld Pip-Boy mods

- Use arm mounted version or [Universal Pip-Boy Customization](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/66598) mod. You must revert to arm mounted before doing Tranquility Lane and Anchorage and taking the train to Vegas the first time. Use UPBC to make this and readius work.

#### After War Nevada

- Completely incompatible.

#### Alt Start Mods

- Will break TTW's starting quest

#### Animation Replacers predating kNVSE like WAR/Hitman's (old)/Asurahs

- Incompatible with the mesh and animation fixes in TTW. Ironsights, reloads for Fallout 3 weapons and other things will not work correctly. kNVSE animations work fine.

#### Armor overhauls

- This includes NCR Overhaul, Legion Overhauls, Book of Steel (without patches), Spice of Life, and any other armor/outfit overhaul. Any of these will require extensive patching. Ones which use body replacers are not compatible period.

#### CAGE/CAE (Continue After Game Ending)

- Use [FPGE](content#fpge) instead.

#### CFW - Classic Fallout Weapons

- Completely incompatible, breaks leveled lists in both games, broken meshes, ctds. Use [CFW Remastered](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/73805).

#### CZ52 mod by kouoaeha

- Broken meshes and recompiles all scripts, will break TTW.

#### Cinemodded Fallout and Patches

- Uses many old and incompatible mods, game breaking ones such as NVEC, CFW and FOOK (which are listed above)

#### Clear Cache Hotkey

- WILL break your game.

#### DUST - Survival simulator

- Completely incompatible; broken mod with over 1,000 errors in xEdit.

#### EVE

- Incompatible weapon meshes and animations.

#### Enhanced NPC Awareness

- Causes random NPCs and companions after firing to become hostile to the player among other issues.

#### FCO - Fallout Character Overhaul

- All versions are known to conflict and break TTW, do not install under any circumstances any part of it.
  - Use [Two Wastelands Redesigned](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/73667) instead.

#### FOOK New Vegas

- Completely incompatible; avoid all outdated "total overhauls" such as this.

#### Fallout 3 mods

- TTW is a New Vegas mod, so mods loaded in FO3 will have no effect, and unconverted mods for FO3 will not work and break TTW.

#### Fallout 4 Commonwealth mods

- This includes armors, items, whatever. Leveled list problems, crashing, lag and other problems.

#### Fallout New California

- No _working_ patch exists (yes, including that one) and making one would be a tremendous amount of work.

#### Fallout Who Vegas

- Dialogue breaks and more, needs rebuilt to work correctly. (Your mod is a buggy mess, not TTW!)

#### Freeside Open and any other mod that makes changes to the Freeside worldspace

- Can be patched

#### GRA integration mods other than SawyerBatty.

#### Game Setting Tuner

- broken, bad scripting that causes save bloat and corruption. Use Stewie Tweak's GMST override feature instead. 

#### HeroinZero's Weapon Fixes compilation by axonis

- These are now fixed by kNVSE, JIP NVSE and Stewies tweaks at the engine level.

#### ILO - Interior Lighting Overhaul

- Old and incompatible, use the lighting mod in the WSG instead

#### IMPACT

- Incompatible hard edits to weapons, but the scripted [Impact Compatibility Edition](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/62050) will work fine.

#### Increased Wasteland Spawns

- Causes massive save bloat and CTD's. Creatures will multiply. Outdated and should be avoided.
  - Use [The Living Desert](content#the-living-desert) for a more alive wasteland.

#### Killable Children (any)

- Incompatible.

#### Leave Conversation

- Force closes dialogues, breaking scripts. Dialogue choices can become locked out, breaking the game.

#### MMM (Mart's Monster Mod)

- Could be patched but would take a lot of effort.

#### MMUE - Mission Mojave Ultimate Edition

- Deletes records TTW needs and reuses Fallout 3 records, it WILL break TTW.

#### Megaton Walkway

- Completely breaks navmeshes in Megaton causing NPCs to teleport under Springvale, someone could fix it.

#### Monster Mod / MoMod

- Totally broken meshes that cause CTDs and broken leveled lists. If you must, try [MoMod Lite](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/71714).

#### Mods that edit companions looks/inventory/whatever directly.

#### More Perks

- Extremely old mod that predates modern script extenders, so many perks are broken or have poor implementation. Redundant Fallout 3 perks,
  spelling and grammar errors abound.

#### Most major overhauls to NV, like DUST

- Just no, will completely break the game due to leveled list changes and/or deleted forms.

#### NVEC - New Vegas Enhanced Content

- Uses many unused records in FNV for it's own stuff, we use the same records because they're FO3 records, it WILL break TTW.

#### PCB Hotkey

- WILL break your game.

#### PLR - Point Lookout Reborn

- Can be patched/reconverted, broken scripts and broken/dirty worldspace/cell edits

#### Project Nevada

- Outdated, broken, obsolete. See [Mods to Avoid](https://vivanewvegas.moddinglinked.com/avoid-mods.html) for what to use instead.

#### Project Weaponry

- Multiple incomplatible meshes, all iron sights broken with TTW.

#### Purge Cell Buffers

- WILL break your game.

#### Star the Wandering Courier

- This mod is antithetical to our mission statement, which is to have a working, bug free as possible game.

#### The Storyteller

- Dirty edits and incompatible conflicts.

#### Unlimited Companions

- Janky mod from 2010, use JIP CCC instead

#### Unofficial Patch NVSE Plus

- script and fix conflicts (not necessary)

#### WMX/WME (Weapon Mods Expanded)

- All meshes are incompatible with fixed animations and problems with texture sets, sound fixes and other issues.
  - Use [Unique Weapons Upgradeable](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/77809) instead.

#### WMIM (Weapon Mesh Improvement Mod)

- already included with TTW and more up to date. Not needed and will cause fix conflicts.

#### Weapons of the New Millenia

- Use [Another Millenia](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/76133) instead.

#### Weapons of the New Millenia and Friends

- CTDs and other quality issues; use [Another Millenia](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/76133) instead.

#### Weapons of the Wasteland

- Causes CTDs.

#### XFO

- Ancient; not even compatible with the current version of vanilla New Vegas.

#### YUP and other unofficial patch mods

- TTW comes with YUPTTW which patches almost all bugs and will continue to do so. TTW itself fixes bugs in Fallout 3 and New Vegas as well, sometimes supersedes fixes in YUP which are then removed from it. Regardless of what VUI+ wants, it is NOT compatible.

#### Zan Autopurge Crash Protector

- WILL break your game.

#### anything that alters the game's timescale

- Internal game functions are tied to time scale , changing them will break AI packages and other things.

## Probably Incompatible

#### Any TTW mod or patch made before November of 2018

- Version differences in TTW mean that compatibility is sometimes out of the question in this situation.

#### Any bug fix mods

- TTW/YUP fixes bugs in both games. If you are aware of a bug which isn't fixed, let the team know. Fixes in NVSE plugins are fine.

#### Custom Race Mods

- Lack child races, cause CTDs.

#### Weapon sound overhauls

- Make edits to weapon records breaking them, can be patched. Use [AWSOME](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/77723).

## Minor Incompatibilities

- Some of Dogmeat's dialogue is hijacked for Guts, Roy is fixing up all of someguy's mods

#### Russell

- Ghoul doctor from Caruthers Canyon will walk to and appear in Underworld due to reused marker/package
- Someguy's mods are all being [remastered](content#the-someguy-series-le) with TTW patches.
